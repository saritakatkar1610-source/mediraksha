 MediRaksha — AI Medical Report Summarizer

MediRaksha is an AI-powered system that analyzes and summarizes medical reports into structured, easy-to-understand insights. It helps doctors quickly interpret reports and enables patients to understand their health in simple language.


 Features

*  Upload medical reports (PDF)
*  Automatic report type detection (Lab, Prescription, Discharge Summary, etc.)
*  AI-powered extraction using LLM (Groq)
*  Structured data extraction:
* Patient details
* Diagnoses
* Lab results
* Medications
* Clinical findings
*  Rule-based validation engine:
* Detects abnormal values
* Infers conditions (e.g., Anaemia, Diabetes)
* Removes incorrect AI outputs
*  Risk level classification (Low / Moderate / High / Critical)
*  Multi-language support (9 Indian languages)
*  Professional PDF report generation
*  Chatbot to ask questions about reports
*  Persistent audit logging using SQLite


 How It Works

1. User uploads a medical report (PDF)
2. System detects report type automatically
3. Extracted text is processed using AI (Groq LLM)
4. Structured data is generated
5. Post-processing engine validates results using medical rules
6. Summary is generated and translated (if needed)
7. Report is stored in audit log database
8. User can interact using chatbot or download PDF
