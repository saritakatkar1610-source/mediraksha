_JSON_RULES = """
STRICT RULES — read carefully:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no preamble, no explanation.
2. Extract ONLY what is explicitly in the document. Never invent or assume.
3. Every key must be present. Use null or [] if not available.
4. Do NOT mix field types — diagnoses must be medical conditions only, never lab values.
5. plain_summary: Write 2-3 clean, complete sentences for a patient or family member.
   - Use confident, direct language. Do NOT use phrases like "may indicate", "could suggest",
     "it appears", "seems to", "possibly", "might be".
   - Use: "The results show...", "The report confirms...", "The patient has...",
     "Treatment includes...", "Follow-up is recommended..."
   - Do NOT repeat the same information twice in the summary.
   - Do NOT end with an incomplete sentence.
6. clinical_findings: Write as a clean paragraph or bullet points. Never as a raw Python
   dict, JSON object, or key-value pairs like {'key': 'value'}.
7. assessment_opinion: Use definitive clinical language. Avoid hedging phrases.

CRITICAL FOR LAB REPORTS — strictly follow these rules:
- "diagnoses" field: ONLY include formally stated medical diagnoses (e.g., "Anemia", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Hypothyroidism"). NEVER put raw lab values, test names, or morphology terms like "Aniso(+)", "Poikilocytosis", "Microcytic" in diagnoses. Those belong in lab_results.
- "lab_results" field: Include ALL test names, their values, units, and reference ranges. Format each test as: "Test Name: value unit (reference: low-high) [NORMAL/LOW/HIGH/CRITICAL]"
- "clinical_findings" field: Morphological observations like Anisocytosis, Poikilocytosis, Hypochromia, target cells — these are microscopic findings, not diagnoses.
- "assessment_opinion" field: Overall lab interpretation — which results are abnormal and what they suggest clinically.
- "diagnoses" field: Only include conditions that are EXPLICITLY stated as diagnoses OR that you can confidently interpret (e.g., if Hemoglobin is 8.0 g/dL with low MCV and MCH, you may infer "Iron Deficiency Anemia" as the interpreted diagnosis).

For key_highlights:
- metric1 should be the most abnormal or critical lab value
- metric2 should be the second most significant abnormal value
